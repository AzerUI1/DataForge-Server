.B GET \fIname\fR
Retrieve and display detailed information for the specified user. Shows all profile fields in a formatted display with creation timestamps.
.TP
.B LIST
Display all users in a professionally formatted table with columns for name, age, email, and phone. Handles empty database state gracefully.

Remove the specified user from the database. Operation is immediate and irreversible once confirmed.
.SS Search & Analytics Commands
.TP
.B SEARCH \fIterm\fR
Search across all user fields (name, email, phone) for the specified term. Returns all matching records with partial matching support.
.TP
.B STATS
Display server performance metrics including total users, operation count, server uptime, and storage file information.
.SS System Operations Commands
.TP
.B BACKUP
Create a manual backup of the current database. Backup files are stored in pipe-separated format for reliability.
.TP
.B GENERATE
Create test data records for development and testing. Prompts for number of records to generate (1-1000 limit).
.TP
.B CLEAR
Wipe the entire database. Requires confirmation with the word "CONFIRM" for security purposes.
.TP
.B HELP
Display the complete command reference with brief descriptions of all available commands.
.TP
.B EXIT
Perform graceful server shutdown with automatic data saving and final log entries.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B enterprise_database.dat
Primary data storage file containing all user records with timestamps.
.TP
.B enterprise_backup.dat
Backup data file created automatically before each save operation.
.TP
.B system_log.txt
Comprehensive activity log with timestamps for all server operations and system events.
.SH DATA FORMAT
The database file uses space-separated values with the following format:
.RS
\fIname age email phone created_timestamp modified_timestamp\fR
.RE
Backup files use pipe-separated values for improved reliability:
.RS
\fIname|age|email|phone|created_timestamp\fR
